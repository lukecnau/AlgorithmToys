# Algorithm Toys
For learning the details of different security algorithms, I implement some of them. 
You can uncomment all the log.printXXX to see the middle-process.

For each of them I just finished the most important parts for observing the insided processes and results, 
that is enough for me to understand them, especially some points many books or specifications do not explain clearly.
I ignored some small features, hence I call it TOY. 

Hash: MD5, SM3, SHA-Family.
Symmetric encryption/decryption: DES, AES, SM4.
Asymmetric encryption/decryption: RSA, SM2.
